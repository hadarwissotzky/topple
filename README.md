## Getting Started

```$bash
gem install jekyll bundler
bundle install
bundle exec jekyll serve 
```

This starts a server, and provides you the port (e.g. `http://127.0.0.1:4000`)

... It also compiles the assets, which can be used to host the static website. Files are located in `_site`.

... It also watches the files for changes, so the scss files and html/markdown files will be compiled as needed,
and updated in `_site`.

## Get started styling

- Main entry point into styles is `_sass/skser.scss`
- Most of the site styles are in `_sass/akser/style.scss` or `_sass/akser/custom.scss` # topple
