                </div>
                <p>Because our competitive world has changed... for good</p>
                <p>Many recognize this. It’s knowing what to do about it that makes up the challenge.</p>
                <p>The most successful, and explosive growth leaders of today – and tomorrow – all reflect a new competitive reality, namely, that the new competitive landscape will be shaped less by firm-specific strategies than by business ecosystems. </p>
                <p>What they are, what role(s) you can play within them, and what capabilities you bring to the table to do so is what Topple describes, based on lessons learned, models used and insights gained from explosive growth companies around the world. </p>
                <p>The book helps you 'make sense' and 'take action' on the new competitive landscape on which every company, everywhere is engaged. </p>
